<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project falls under my MSc Computer Science research. It is starting out simple with a user-friendly interface for building and testing automata. Later down the line we are planning on adding automata-based games and more.

### Built With

As the project grows and more layers are added to the architecture this section will be updated. For now it is entirely frontend and built entirely with React.

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
